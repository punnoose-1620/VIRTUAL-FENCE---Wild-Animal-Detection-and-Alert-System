VIRTUAL FENCE - Wild Animal Detection and Alert System 

This is a beginner level project based on detecting wild animals from input video and generating an alert on connected Arduino Uno using generic Buzzer. This was implemented using YOLOv2 and has a very low accuracy rate which has not been tested properly. 

A formal IEEE paper and Project report have been prepared and submitted at various paper presentations as of now, and hence, shall not be included in this repository.
